            After starting with the production of characters from the game Genshin Impact (which you can freely find and buy <a href="https://payhip.com/nahtelie" target="_blank" rel="external">Here)</a> Naht specialized in creating the members of the K-pop group Stray Kids. <br>
            The success was as sudden as it was unexpected, leading to the creation of new rules and guidelines, justifying this FAQ. <br>
            The POPs are 100% handmade. Zero scanning, zero 3D printing. <br>
            They are not based on customized Funko POP models. <br>
            Naht creates them from start to finish. It's true artisanal work. <br>
            Soon, Naht hopes to further diversify production, incorporating other inspirations.
            But that's for later. ü§´

            Keeping the ordering system always open would only increase and make production/delivery times uncertain. <br>
              For this reason, only one order per person is accepted during each opening to ensure as many subscribers as possible get a chance to own a POP. <br>
            Currently, there are 40 spots available per opening, with an estimated production time of 5 to 6 months.

            There are three ways to do this. <br>
            Assuming you're a subscriber and want to take advantage of the exclusive benefits ($1.99 per month). <br> <br>
            <b>1.	The waiting list</b> <br> <br>
            Subscribing guarantees a spot (first benefit). <br>
            The first 16 on the list are guaranteed to be able to place an order. <br>
            You can check your position on the <a href="https://bmaizena.github.io/shufflecodes/nahtelie/listsub.html"  target="_blank" rel="external">List</a>, based on the subscription order (Instagram username). <br>
            Naht will contact you individually to confirm your interest. <br>
            In case of refusal or no response, the released spots will be given to the next people on the list. <br>
            Remember: only one order per person. <br>
            If you are among the 16 lucky ones, you cannot try again with the other methods explained below. <br> <br>
            <b>2.	The raffle</b> <br> <br>
            Available spots: 10. <br>
            The raffle is done live for subs on Instagram for transparency reasons. <br>
            You don't need to watch live to claim your prize. <br>
            Winners will be contacted individually by Naht for confirmation, as in the first option. <br>
            If you decline the offer, your spot will go to the next subscriber on the waiting list. <br>
            You can see your raffle number <a href="https://bmaizena.github.io/shufflecodes/nahtelie/index.html"  target="_blank" rel="external">Here</a> (order doesn't matter). <br>
            Remember: to ensure everyone can experience the joy of owning a POP, only one order per person is allowed. Therefore, you cannot try your luck with the last method. <br> <br>

            <b>If I‚Äôm not a subscriber, can I still order? Yes</b> <br> <br>

            <b>3. The form (Google Form)</b> <br> <br>

            Fortunately, Naht thinks on everyone! <br>
            You don‚Äôt have to be a subscriber to get a POP (although it increases your chances). <br>
            The date indicated in the Instagram bio will be the only order date for everyone (non-subscribers and subscribers). <br>
            The first 14 to submit the order form will secure their spot. <br>
            The exact opening time will be specified in the story. <br>
            Set a reminder so you're not caught off guard by the time zone! <br>
            When the time comes, click on the link available only on the ‚ÄúUpdates‚Äù Instagram channel. <br>
            You will be asked for your Instagram username, name, and country. <br>
            The rule is simple: first come, first served. <br>
            <b>Attention, submitting the form does not guarantee your spot.</b> <br>
            Naht will announce the names of the winners in the subscriber discussion groups and privately for non-subscribers. Your spot will only be confirmed if your name is on the list provided by Naht. <br> <br>

            <b>Did I say this was the last option?</b> <br> <br>

            <b>4.	The subscriber gift (Giveaway)</b> <br> <br>
            Naht wants to thank you for your support. <br>
            As long as we have over 100 subscribers, every 2 months, a giveaway will allow one subscriber to receive the POP of their choice, completely free! <br>

            For an idea, the starting price is $60 and can go up to $70. <br>

            No. Once you receive a POP, your name is simply removed. <br>

            Fortunately for Naht, the number of subscribers keeps growing. <br>

            No. You can have as many as you want. <br>
            Or rather, as many as you can order during each opening, respecting the 4 ordering methods explained earlier. <br> <br>

            <b>3.	How do I make a collection if I‚Äôm no longer guaranteed a spot on the waiting list?</b> <br> <br>
            There‚Äôs still the raffle and the subscriber giveaway (your luck) or the form (your speed). <br>
            But above all, you‚Äôll need to be patient, as you can only order one POP per opening.(or 2 if you are lucky enough to win the Giveaway and get a spot) <br> <br>

            <b>4.	Why doesn‚Äôt the waiting list take priority over those who already have several?</b> <br> <br>
            While some people are satisfied with just one POP, others wish to build a collection. <br>
            Please respect these personal choices and, most importantly, Naht‚Äôs work and the way she wants to manage her business. <br>
            Keep in mind that Naht, just like you, wishes for everyone to have their own piece. <br>
            But the meticulous and fully handmade nature of the work doesn‚Äôt allow for that. <br>
            Just as she cannot prevent others from purchasing her creations. <br> <br>
            <b>5.	Can I pay extra to reserve a spot?</b> <br> <br>
            Naht‚Äôs only income comes from the price of the POP and the subscriptions to her Instagram account. <br>
            No privileges are granted, and any attempt at extra payment will be refused.
