I’m doing this on her behalf to help out and hopefully provide all the information that might be required as prospective clients or just fans of her work! Let’s get right into it.

            Naht takes orders when the previous set of POPs have been made and shipped; so there is not fixed timescale. The date is on Nahts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nah.telie/" target="_blank" rel="external">Instagram</a>, but I will keep it up to date here too.<b> The next vacancy is 13th October.</b>

            Currently Naht offers <b>32</b> POPs per opening. These are divided into three avenues, these are as follows:
            <br> <br>
 
            <b>Subscriber Queue for those without a POP.</b> <br>
            Everyone who is a subscriber who has never received a POP (from any way) is part of the Subscriber Queue. Each vacancy the 12 who are at the front will be offered a chance to get a POP. If for whatever reason you are not in a position to say yes (or you miss the message!), you will maintain your queue position for the next vacancy to be offered again. You can view your queue position here: <a href="https://bmaizena.github.io/shufflecodes/nahtelie/listsub.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Waiting List</a> <br> <br>
            
            <b>Subscriber Raffle.</b> <br>
            Everyone who is a subscriber is entered into a raffle. Naht will draw people at random and 8 who are drawn will be offered the chance for a POP, this is done on an Instagram Live if you wish to view along! If you do not wish to say yes at this time, Naht will offer the spot to the next in the Subscriber Queue. This raffle will be drawn a day or so before the Open Offer Form date. You can view you raffle draw number here: <a href="https://bmaizena.github.io/shufflecodes/nahtelie/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external"> Subscribers IDs</a> <br><br>
            
            <b>Open Offer Form</b> <br>
            The final 12 are offered to both Subscribers and General Public via a form, published on Nahts Instagram via the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/channel/AbbutNG_1q0sxpCf/" target="_blank" rel="external">Updates Channel</a>. In the run up to the opening date, Naht will make public what time the form will go live. The form asks for three pieces of information. Your Instagram username, your actual name and the country the POP will be shipped to. The spots from this are given in a first come first serve basis. There is no bias to subscribers or locations in the world

            Pricing of a POP depends on complexity and Naht will inform you of the exact pricing. The price starts at US$60, and a more complex can run to US$70. This can be paid via PayPal, and will be made at the end of production, after seeing videos of your completed POP. Shipping will depend on your country, but due to package size and fragile nature, roughly in region of US$45-50.
            By being a subscriber, you receive a 10% discount on your POP!

            Once you have secured a spot, Naht will be in touch to get specifications. Please have this ready before the vacancy opening if possible. Naht will need the details of the member you want, along with outfit details. This can be given vi links to videos where they wore the outfit in question. Screenshots are also ideal, presented in a pdf document. Please show the hairstyle, jewellery, clothes and shoes. If you can find links to the actual clothes, please provide those. You will also need to advise on what pose you wish for the POP to be made in. <br> <br>

            Alternatively, if Naht has already made the POP you want, you can just inform her which one it is, and any pose amendments you desire. <br> <br>
            
            A good example of what to supply is attached. Notes, different views, all help. Remember, Naht wants to make the POP you want; so provide her with as much detail as you can to help with that.

            From the Opening, Naht will take some orders from each avenue and make them. For example, three from subscriber queue, two from raffle and three from the form. You can look up the sequence for orders <a href="https://bmaizena.github.io/shufflecodes/nahtelie/vagas.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Here</a>. Depending on your place, it can take a few months from Opening to your POP going into production. Reminder, these are all handmade by one person. Patience is requested!

            Every two months Naht will make a drawer based on the subscriber raffle list and that person will win a POP for FREE (including shipping)! Please note, by winning this, it will remove you from the Subscriber Queue if you had not previously received a POP. However, it does not exclude you from entering to obtain a POP via a standard order Opening. 

            The Subscriber Raffle list will have the most recent winner highlighted in yellow if you wish to check, you can view the list <a href="https://bmaizena.github.io/shufflecodes/nahtelie/index.html " target="_blank" rel="external">Here</a>

          <div class="accordion-body">
            Unfortunately not. Once you have a POP your name is removed from the subscriber queue, it isn’t put to the back of it or anything. This is because there can always be new subscribers and the queue is for people who have never had a POP.

            Technically no, you can have as many as you want/are able to get. However, per opening you are only able to obtain one. As previously mentioned, being the winner of the Subscriber Giveaway does not exclude you from ordering via Opening.

            Please don’t hesitate to ask. If there is a common ask, it can be added to here to help in future. Most of all, please remember to have patience and be kind. The work Naht does is all by hand, is time consuming and is very detailed. I know she would like to be able to get POPs for everyone. Frustration is understandable for a limited item but remember we are all part of the same community, and that for Naht this is both a business but her hobby also.
